O'Chess is a simple complete chess program written in O'Caml.

This repository contains two minor fixes regarding castling rights and the 50-move draw rule.
In addition, `package.json` and `bsconfig.json` have been added for use with _Bucklescript_.
I also uncommented the main program loop so that O'Chess can be used as a library
(see e.g. [my chess SPA tutorial](https://github.com/quernd/tea-chess)).
